# Rotation Sensor BCD ⚙️

**Rotation Sensor BCD** demonstrates the integration of a rotation sensor with an FPGA board and a BCD display. This project showcases hardware-level communication and real-time visualization of sensor data. It is ideal for educational purposes, hardware testing, or as a base for more advanced embedded systems.

## Features
- **Rotation sensor integration** – Measures and processes rotation data using an FPGA.
- **BCD display** – Real-time visualization of sensor data in binary-coded decimal format.
- **Custom FPGA logic** – Implements data processing and output using FPGA programming.
- **Hardware setup** – Easy-to-configure connections using cables and components.

## Technologies and Components
- **Rotation sensor** – For measuring angular position or speed.
- **BCD display** – To display numerical data in human-readable form.
- **FPGA board** – Implements the logic for data processing and output control.
- **Connection cables** – For linking components and ensuring power and signal integrity.

## Hardware Setup
1. Connect the rotation sensor to the FPGA board.
2. Interface the BCD display with the FPGA's output pins.
3. Ensure all connections are secure and powered correctly.
4. Load the custom logic onto the FPGA to enable data processing and display.
